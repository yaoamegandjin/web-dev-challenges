## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned
The most important thing I learned from this challenge is how to do form validation using JavaScript. 


### Continued development

The responsiveness of my designs definitely needs some improvement. Do they work? Yes. But I am sure there are more elegant ways to go about it. Same thing for my css styling. My JavaScript definitely needs some improvement. JavaScript is the only programming language that when I look at, I feel overwhelmed when it comes to all the things you can do and all the many way you can go about it.

### Useful resources

- [Web Technologies Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I wonder what I would do without MDN, when I looking at somebodies implementation of JavaScript form validation and I didn't understand a line of code, I used MDN.
- [CSS Selectors Cheatsheet](frontend30.com) - Who doesn't need a CSS Selector Cheatsheet lol

- [Form validation tutorial](https://dev.to/tracy4code/form-validation-with-javascript-21l) - I looked at a lot of tutorial but this one was the most helpful when it came to the form validation
