## 🧾 Overview

This project is a responsive, accessible contact form built with semantic HTML, modern CSS (Flexbox & Grid), and vanilla JavaScript. It validates input on the client side and provides user feedback using visual cues and screen reader-friendly messages.

---

## 🏁 The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- ✅ Complete the form and see a success toast message upon submission
- ✅ Receive validation messages when:
  - A required field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- ✅ Use only their keyboard to fill and submit the form
- ✅ Have inputs, error messages, and success messages announced via screen reader
- ✅ See optimal layouts on different screen sizes (mobile/desktop)
- ✅ Experience clear hover and focus states on interactive elements

## 📚 What I Learned

> “The most important thing I learned from this challenge is how to do **form validation using JavaScript**.”

Other takeaways:

- Implementing **real-time form feedback**
- Structuring responsive layouts using modern CSS tools

---

## 🧩 Continued Development

I want to improve:

- **Responsiveness** – my current design works, but it could be more elegant.
- **CSS styling** – it's functional, but needs refinement for scalability.
- **JavaScript** – it often feels overwhelming due to the number of ways to solve a single problem. Continued practice will help my confidence.
