### 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**

### 🧠 What I Learned

> Practice or you will lose your skills.  
> This is my first frontend design challenge in months. It took me a bit to refresh my memory on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, but it was a great reminder of how important consistency is in coding.

### 🔄 Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my responsive design skills. Although this component was static, I want to practice adapting layouts for different screen sizes more efficiently.
